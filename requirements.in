# Used for bluetooth tethering plugin.
dbus-python

# Used for parsing LastSession logs in manual mode.

# Only using basic Flask and Flask plugin features.
# Should be kept up-to-date as Flask is notorious for breaking
# environments with their extremely loose dependency definitions.

# Used for modeling AI parameters.
# NOTE: stable-baselines wants gym[atari,classic_control] but we
# can't satisfy the "atari" extra because it requires ale-py
# which has no source distributions or RasPi wheels.
# Using pip's new backtracking resolver from pip>=20.3 is required
# as it improves handling of extras required by indirect dependencies.
# NOTE: gym v0.22 modified the gym.Env API.

# Used for Inky pHAT and wHAT displays.

# Used in the AI and UI layers.
# Only using basic numpy features.
#numpy>=1.21.4 # Moved to 1.21.4 from 1.20
numpy

# Used in the UI layer.
# Only using core PIL features (Image, ImageFont, ImageDraw).
# Very stable library, should be safe to upgrade.
Pillow

# Used for pwngrid identity verification (PKCS1, RSA, SHA256).
# Very stable library, should be safe to upgrade.
pycryptodome

# Used for GPS plugin to parse a GPS datetime string.
python-dateutil

# Used exclusively to convert legacy YAML configs to TOML.
PyYAML

# Used for HTTP requests with bettercap, pwngrid, and plugins.
# Only using core library features (GET, POST, Sessions).
# Very stable library, should be safe to upgrade.
requests

# Used for WiFi pwnage and WiGLE plugin.
scapy

# I2C/SPI communication with displays, also used by some plugins.
smbus2
spidev

# Primary AI library.  Safe to upgrade as v3 is a different package.
# Upgrading to stable-baselines3 is currently impossible because
# it depends on PyTorch which requires a 64-bit processor.
stable-baselines

# stable-baselines made a mistake.
# stable-baselines has a tensorflow requirement of ">=1.8.0,<2.0.0",
# but the requirement is the result of a calculation during setup.
# As a result, the requirement is entirely missing from the wheel file.
# Furthermore, "<2.0.0" will fail because tensorflow v1.14 contains
# breaking API changes in preparation for their v2.X release.
